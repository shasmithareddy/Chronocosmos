  desc: `On June 20, 1978, astronomer James Christy, working at the U.S. Naval Observatory, noticed an unusual bulge in photographic images of Pluto. After careful analysis, he realized this was not a flaw but evidence of a companion moon, later named Charon. The discovery of Charon was pivotal, as it allowed astronomers to accurately determine Pluto’s mass and provided new insights into the dynamics of the Pluto-Charon system. Charon is unusually large compared to Pluto, making the pair more of a binary system than a typical planet-moon relationship. This breakthrough fundamentally changed our understanding of the outer solar system and set the stage for future missions, such as New Horizons, to explore these distant worlds in detail.`

The crew spent over three weeks aboard, setting a new record for time spent in space and conducting valuable scientific experiments. Tragically, during re-entry, a cabin vent valve opened prematurely, causing depressurization. All three cosmonauts lost their lives, making them the only humans to die in space beyond Earth’s atmosphere. The incident led to significant redesigns in Soviet spacecraft, including the requirement for cosmonauts to wear pressure suits during critical mission phases.`

  desc: `On June 30, 1908, a massive explosion occurred over the remote Tunguska region of Siberia, flattening over 2,000 square kilometers of forest. The event is believed to have been caused by the airburst of a small asteroid or comet, releasing energy equivalent to 10–15 megatons of TNT. No impact crater was found, but the devastation was immense, with millions of trees knocked down in a radial pattern. The Tunguska Event remains the largest impact event in recorded history and serves as a stark reminder of the potential hazards posed by near-Earth objects. It has inspired ongoing efforts to monitor and defend against asteroid threats.`
